Compute Engine - Make CogniMem a Computing Database

This module transforms CogniMem from a thinking database into a computing database.
It provides:
1. Stored Procedures - Named operations on concepts
2. Triggers - Event-driven hooks for concept changes
3. Derived Properties - Computed properties with caching
4. Graph Traversal - Navigate concept relations (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
5. Constraint Solver - Find concepts satisfying constraints
6. Statistical Aggregations - Analytics across concepts
7. Materialized Views - Cached query results with auto-refresh
